## Weather mining


* This is working with ghncd daily data from NOAA
* This script parses the daily data down to monthy averages with standard devs and min/max
* Output options in csv format and sqlite format
* This is only US data for now 250ish megs compressed vs ~3ish gigs compressed
    * theoretically would work with the big global dataset
